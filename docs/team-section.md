# Team section (`TeamSection.tsx`)

Renders **`#team`** directly under the [Mooric ERP blueprint band](./hero-motion-band.md). Seven people on a **clay / neumorphic** band (same language as Production Glance).

## Layout

- Surface: `.section-neu` clay; portraits in `.neu-pad` frames; padding `py-36 sm:pb-48 sm:pt-40`
- Desktop content rail capped at **`max-w-5xl`**
- Intro eyebrow + **`OUR TEAM`** stay in a centered `max-w-3xl` block; subtitle spans the full **`max-w-5xl`** rail on desktop so it doesn’t orphan a single word on the second line
- Subtitle line break after **“platform”** when the team rail is too narrow for four cards (`@container/team` + `@max-[979px]/team:block` on the `<br>` — matches `4 × 14rem + 3 × 1.75rem` card/gap math); stays split on all smaller viewports
- Single `flex-wrap` row — no horizontal overflow
- Mobile: two columns (`calc(50% - 0.75rem)`)
- `sm+`: fixed card widths (`13rem` / `14rem`)
- Portraits **4:5**, capped at 220px wide, `object-cover object-center`, 5px ERP bar along the bottom edge
- Name/title plate: same `.neu-pad` clay extrusion as Production Glance (no white fill); `0.9rem` corners; type unchanged (ink name, ERP title)
